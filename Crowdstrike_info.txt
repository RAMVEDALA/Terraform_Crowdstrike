###The Big Picture###
----------------

a)Hosts are placed into host groups
b)Make the policies that you want for the host group
c)Those policies make up the Prevention policy
d)Assign a Prevention policy to a host group




Sensor Update policy
Prevention Policy
Firewall Policy
Response policy
USB Device policy



####Prevention Policies####
------------------------

Examples of Prevention policies in windows:

Rapid Deployment policy, Control group policy, Exceptions Group policy,
Default workstation Policy, Default Server Policy, 



Under prevention policy in falcon console we have different tabs like:
-Settings
-Assigned Host Groups
-Assigned Custom IOAs



We have different policies like
Firewall policy, Sensor Update policy, IOA policy, NGAV policy
when we put all together then it is Prevention policy


What makes up Prevention policies
---------------------------------
1) Sensor visibilities
2) NGAV(can slide the detection vs prevention settings from cautious->extra aggressive)
3) Malware Protection
4) Behavior and ML detections

Under Prevention policy
there are different types

A)Sensor Visibility
Categories:
a)Enhanced Visibility
b)Hardware-Enhanced Visibility

B)Next-Gen Antivirus
Categories:
a)Cloud Machine Learning
-Cloud Anti-malware   (values are Disabled, Cautious, Moderate, Aggressive, Extra Aggressive)
We need to always have more Detection and Less Prevention
Detection    Disabled, Cautious, Moderate, Aggressive, Extra Aggressive
Prevention   Disabled, Cautious, Moderate, Aggressive, Extra Aggressive
-Adware & Pup         (values are Disabled, Cautious, Moderate, Aggressive, Extra Aggressive)

b)Sensor Machine Learning
c)On-Demand Scans Machine Learning
d)On-Demand Scans
e)On-Write
f)Quarantine

C)Malware Protection
Categories:
a)Execution Blocking

D)Behavior-Based Prevention
Categories:
a)Expolit Mitigation
b)Ransomware
c)Expolitation Behavior
d)Lateral Movement and Credential Access
e)Remediation


Prevention Policy Precedence
--------------------------
Hosts may be assigned to more than one policy
If no host assigned to a policy, it will drop to the last precedence policy=default
Default = catch all policy

Make one: endpoint security>prevention policies>create new> platform>name>create
-enable settings>save>confirm>enable>enable policy

-Set the precedence order

Precedence is important

you can have as many policies based on level of organisation and your use cases

like 11 or 25 etc and give precedence by toggling up or down in the console

host will pick the lower precedence value policy 
ex: host is attached to 2 policies with precedence 4 and 2, host group will pick up policy 2 as it has highest precedence



Default, Phase 1,2,3 Prevention policies
--------------------------------------------
Default(Windows)
Default(Mac)
Default(Linux)

Phase 1 --Initial deployment
-Intended for customers setting up falcon for first time
-rapid deployment strategy, doesn't fully protect, should be used during initial deployment and alongside an AV
-Should used for minimum time

Phase 2 -- Interim protection
-Intended if you have no AV(Anti virus) or EDR solution currently in placed
-a bit more protective in policy settings
-Start introducing your IOA

Phase 3 -- Optimal protection
-The ideal standard level of protection for your hosts
-Should try to get here in 90 days or less to ensure adequate protection of your endpoints


As you increase the phase, fine tune your false positives, as it will become more aggressive and preventive
add your exclusions/whitelisting

monitor your rollouts, pushing your groups to one of these phases
keep an eye if host drops into default policy, if there any missed one address it and assign it to a policy

Ask yourself as an admin:
What prevention policy makes sense to you in your environment
what rollout makes sense



Sensor Update policy
-------------------

Sensor update schedule using non prod hours
use n-1 or n-2 versions in prod  -- this is "sensor version" which helps in downgrade or upgrade the build



We have types

A) Sensor Protection
category:
a)sensor uninstall and maintenance
-uninstall and maintenance protection
-Bulk maintenance mode   --- we can use 1 token to uninstall sensors on multiple machines at once


once you create a policy we need to Policy status(enable) it to make some changes
and this policies will also have precedence


Throttle sensor update rate --- this is to limit how many sensor updates can be installed per minute.
we can update this no of hosts per minute based on network bandwidth

increase or decrease this value based on network bandwidth

Throttle Channel File updates  --- limit the size of channel file updates by time period
